# GenPathway

GenPathway allows low-income, first-generation students to connect with their perfect colleges. Our web app includes filter-based college search, blog posts giving detailed information about college lifestyles, and, most importantly, 1-1 chats with college representatives. We believe that everyone, despite financial status, should have a fair hand in getting a higher education. As of this reason, GenPathways was built. So, help us build a pathway to a brighter future.
